Author: **Nico Stephan Gorbach**

Sample code for the paper **Pipeline Validation for Connectivity-based Cortex Parcellation** by Nico S. Gorbach, Marc Tittgemeyer and Joachim M. Buhmann (in submission). The doctoral thesis https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/261734 contains more detailed descriptions and derivations.

The Matlab image processing toolbox is required.

Run the Matlab script *main_cortex_parcellation.m* in the *empirical* folder or one of the Matlab scripts *main_1D_connectivity*, *main_probability_simplex* or *main_anatomical_context* in the subfolders contained in the *simulations* folder.
