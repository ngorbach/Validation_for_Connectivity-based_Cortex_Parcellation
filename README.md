Code for the paper **Pipeline Validation for Connectivity-based Cortex Parcellation** by Nico S. Gorbach, Marc Tittgemeyer and Joachim M. Buhmann. 

The Matlab image processing toolbox is required.

Run the Matlab script *main_cortex_parcellation.m* in the *empirical* folder or one of the Matlab scripts *main_1D_connectivity*, *main_probability_simplex* or *main_anatomical_context* in the subfolders contained in the *simulation* folder.
